## The Secrets Revealed

You quickly pull out the top letter, shielding it from the rain. It is written in a hurried, elegant script, addressed from the Duke to a woman named **"Lyra."** Trix scans the urgent lines:

> *"...the situation at the **Ivory Tower** is worse than we thought. The master mage, **Soron**, has sealed the upper levels and refuses to respond. My agents believe he is preparing to use the **Shattered Crown** artifact, which we foolishly allowed him to study. If he combines its power with the Tower's ancient focus, the entire district will be caught in his spell. You must recover the Crown, Lyra, before the next full moon. I have dispatched a unit—a captain and a brute—to the docks to meet with Spike. Do not fail me."*
