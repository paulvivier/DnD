That's an excellent idea. A map will help you visualize the next steps and the danger zones!

Since I can't generate a true visual map within this text format, I will describe the city's key districts and plot the locations as points of interest within those areas, giving you a clear mental picture of **Silverhaven City**.

## Silverhaven City Map: Key Locations

Silverhaven is a sprawling city built around a massive, central harbor. The city is broadly divided by wealth and function, generally flowing upward from the rough, industrial docks to the pristine, elevated towers.

### 1. The Dockside & Wet Quarter (Low Threat/High Chaos)
This is the lowest, oldest, and most chaotic part of the city, built on reclaimed marshland. It's defined by narrow, wet alleys, cheap warehouses, and dense housing. This is Trix's home turf and the hunting grounds for the thugs.

* **Wet Quarter Alley:** The site of the initial snatch, where Trix stole the letters from Spike.
* **The Bent Mug:** The Innkeeper's establishment and the party's current **safe haven**. It's located in an older, slightly quieter section on the border of the Wet Quarter and the main city.
* **The Docks:** The location where the **Duke's Agents (Captain and Brute)** were dispatched. It's a high-threat zone.

### 2. The Merchant District (High Traffic/Neutral)
This is the wide, bustling commercial heart of Silverhaven, situated on mid-level ground. It's full of shops, public institutions, and main thoroughfares.

* **(General Thoroughfares):** The main streets Trix and Grog used to escape the docks and reach the Inn.

### 3. The Temple District (Mid-Level Threat/High Visibility)
A high-traffic, spiritual center on a rise above the rest of the city. It's generally well-patrolled, making it risky for a running rogue.

* **The Alcove:** The recessed spot where Trix opened the letters and was first confronted by Silas.
* **Temple Square:** The large, open plaza where Grog was standing guard over the "sacred plant" and successfully intimidated Spike. **Silas** is currently observing from the shadow of a nearby side alley.

### 4. The Ivory Peaks (High Threat/High Value)
This is the elevated, prestigious area of the city, home to nobles, academics, and the most powerful arcane structures. It overlooks the entire city.

* **The Ivory Tower:** The ultimate target location. It's a massive, ancient arcane structure sealed by **Master Mage Soron**. It is the location of the **Shattered Crown** artifact and the source of the main plot threat. It is located far across the city from your current location.
