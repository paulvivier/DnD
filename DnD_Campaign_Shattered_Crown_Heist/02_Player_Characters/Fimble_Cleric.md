### The Basics & Personality

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Class Feature** | **Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity.** As an action, Fimble creates an illusionary, perfect duplicate of herself. She can cast spells as if she were in the duplicate's space. **Spellcasting:** Uses **Wisdom** for powerful healing magic. |
| **Race Feature** | **Gnome Cunning:** Advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic. **Minor Illusion:** Can cast the *Minor Illusion* cantrip (perfect for pranks!). |
| **Background Feature** | **False Identity (Charlatan):** Fimble has created a secondary persona, complete with a ready-made disguise and set of contacts, which she can use to gather information. |
| **Personality Trait**| I can't resist a good practical joke, even if it delays my objective. The best way to cheer someone up is a well-timed, harmless prank. |
| **Ideal** | **Redemption.** I use deceit and trickery to expose the real liars in the world, believing everyone deserves a chance to mend their ways. |
| **Bond** | A fellow trickster and rogue once covered for me when I pulled a con that went horribly wrong. |
| **Flaw** | If a lie or trick is good enough, I'll believe it, which sometimes makes me gullible to those who are better than I am. |
| **Weapons** | **Mace** (1d6 Bludgeoning), **Light Crossbow** (1d8 Piercing). |
| **Armor** | **Chain Mail** (Medium Armor) and a **Shield**. |
