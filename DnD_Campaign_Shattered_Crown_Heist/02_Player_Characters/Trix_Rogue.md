| **Class Feature** | **Sneak Attack ($\mathbf{1d6}$):** Deal extra damage once per turn against a creature you have advantage against, or if an ally is within 5 feet of them. **Expertise:** Double proficiency bonus on **Sleight of Hand** and **Stealth**. |

| **Background Feature** | **City Secrets (Urchin):** You know the hidden paths and back alleys of any settlement and can always find a place to hide or recuperate among the poor. |

| **Ideal** | **Freedom.** Everyone should be free to pursue their own destiny and ambition, even if it means breaking a few rules. |
| **Bond** | I owe a debt to the kind, elderly **Innkeeper** who didn't turn me in when I was caught stealing bread. |
| **Flaw** | I can't help but pocket anything shiny I see. I lack academic patience. |
