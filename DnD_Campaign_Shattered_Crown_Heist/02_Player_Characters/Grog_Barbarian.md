### The Basics & Personality

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Class Feature** | **Rage:** As a bonus action, Grog can enter a rage. While raging, he has advantage on Strength checks and saves, gets a damage bonus to melee attacks ($\mathbf{+2}$ at Lvl 1), and resistance to slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage. |
| **Race Feature** | **Savage Attacks:** Roll one additional weapon damage die when scoring a critical hit with a melee weapon. **Relentless Endurance:** Once per long rest, Grog drops to 1 HP instead of 0 HP. |
| **Background Feature** | **Wanderer (Outlander):** Grog has an excellent memory for maps and geography. He can accurately recall the layout of any wilderness or natural terrain he has travelled. |
| **Personality Trait**| I'm a good listener. I rarely speak unless I have something important to say, but I'm fiercely attentive to those I protect. |
| **Ideal** | **Protection.** Those who cannot defend themselves deserve to have someone stand between them and danger. |
| **Bond** | I once rescued a small, strangely ornate **bear cub** that I still carry with me in a pouch. I must keep it safe. |
| **Flaw** | I don't understand city customs or complex social rules, and I sometimes break things without meaning to. |
| **Weapons** | **Great Axe** ($\mathbf{1d12}$ Slashing, Heavy, Two-Handed), two **Handaxes** ($\mathbf{1d6}$ Slashing, Light, Thrown). |
| **Armor** | None (Relies on **Unarmored Defense**). |
