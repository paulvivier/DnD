### Immediate Antagonists

**Spike:** A small-time criminal and local fence easily identified by his **gold tooth**. He was last seen in a Wet Quarter alley and is now absolutely **frantic and hunting Trix**, having lost the Duke's letters. He is terrified of the consequences and the Duke's agents and is personally invested in recovering his lost goods.

**Spike's Thugs:** Two large, burly enforcers who accompanied Spike to the meeting. They are simple muscle following Spike's orders and showed a particular interest in information about the **Shattered Crown**. They are currently searching the docks and alleys.

**The Captain & The Brute:** These are the Duke's professional agents. The **Captain** is likely the competent, relentless tracker, while the **Brute** is the heavy muscle. They were dispatched to meet Spike and are now actively searching the docks for the stolen letters, posing a high and immediate threat to the party.

### Central Plot Figures

**Master Mage Soron:** The primary antagonist of the entire plot. He is a powerful wizard who has sealed himself inside the **Ivory Tower**. His goal is to use the dangerous artifact, the **Shattered Crown**, before the next full moon, an action that threatens to engulf the entire district in his powerful spell.

**The Duke:** A noble or authority figure in Silverhaven and the original owner of the stolen letters. He is trying to secretly prevent Soron's plan and recover the **Shattered Crown**, suggesting he has a vested interest in the artifact's power or safety.

**Lyra:** The Duke's primary, trusted agent. She was the intended recipient of the letters and is the one actively tasked with stopping Soron and recovering the **Shattered Crown**. She is likely a high-ranking operative who may become an ally or a rival to the party.
