## A Wet Job in the Wet Quarter
![Trix](../02_Player_Characters/Trix_Rogue_img1.png)

The city of **Silverhaven** is a bustling, chaotic metropolis, currently being soaked by a relentless, cold drizzle. You, **Trix** the Halfling Rogue, are currently perched on a slick, moss-covered rooftop in the **Wet Quarter**—a grimy dockside district known for its smuggled goods and whispered deals.

You’ve been tracking a local fence named **"Spike"** who is known for hoarding valuable, sealed letters meant for the city's nobility. Trix figured one of those letters would fetch enough coin to start funding his magical education.

Peering down into the narrow alleyway below, you see a flash of light reflecting off a single gold tooth. Spike. He is leaning against the back door of a run-down fish market, arguing quietly with two burly, cloaked thugs who are twice Trix’s size. Spike is wearing a heavy, oilskin coat, and you see the distinct bulge of the letters hidden inside his inner pocket.

The alley is loud with the sound of rain, but getting down there is tricky:

1.  A rickety **drainpipe** runs from your position down to the alley, offering a direct, if noisy, route.
2.  The rooftop continues across to the building opposite, and a narrow **clothesline** is strung between the two—a slower but more discreet option.

**Top-Pinned Summary Reminder:** *Trix is a **Level 1 Stout Halfling Rogue** with **DEX +3** and **Expertise in Stealth (+7)**. He wants the letters to fund his **dream of magic**.*

***

**What does Trix do?**

---

Trix looks around for any other non obvious way down.

---

You have Trix pause, scanning the murky alley and the surrounding rooftops for a third, non-obvious route.

The rickety drainpipe and the swaying clothesline are clear risks, but Trix trusts his street instincts over an obvious path. The constant drizzle makes every surface treacherously slick.

You focus your gaze on the roof edge just a few feet away from the fish market. You notice something promising: a series of **narrow, empty wooden crates** stacked precariously against the wall near the back door. They look like they were meant to be hauled up to a storage loft, but the rope is currently frayed and hanging loose.

If Trix can make a small jump, he could potentially use the crates as unstable stepping stones down the last 15 feet to the ground, positioning himself right behind the three men. The advantage is that this route is likely quieter than the metal drainpipe.

***

**What does Trix do?**

1.  **Go for the Crates:** Attempt a running jump to land on the top crate, then carefully climb down. This will require an **Acrobatics (DEX)** check.
2.  **Use the Clothesline:** Attempt to traverse the rope to the opposite roof, then find another way down from there. This will require a **Sleight of Hand (DEX)** check to maintain balance.
3.  **Use the Drainpipe:** Risk the loud, direct route and hope the rain covers the noise. This will require a **Stealth (DEX)** check.

---

Let's use the Clothesline.

---
Trix eyes the rickety wooden crates and decides they look like an invitation to a broken leg. The **clothesline**, though exposed, offers a more controlled descent.

It’s about a 20-foot stretch of frayed, wet rope strung between the two buildings. The rain is making the rope slick, and the wind occasionally causes it to sway violently. Trix will need to traverse it quickly and quietly.

### The Clothesline Challenge

Roll an **Acrobatics (DEX)** check to balance on the swaying, wet rope. You are proficient in Acrobatics.

**Your Modifier:** +3  (DEX)+ 2  (Proficiency)= +5

**Please make a 1d20+ 5 roll and tell me the result!**

*(Note: While I suggested Sleight of Hand, Acrobatics is a better fit for a balancing act, and you are proficient in it, so we'll use that!)*

---

14

---

A roll of 14, plus your Acrobatics modifier of +5, gives Trix a total of **19**.

The rain is relentless, making the rope feel like oiled glass, but Trix is a creature of the city's highest, slickest places. You move with the silent, fluid grace of a cat. Every sway of the rope is anticipated, every knot is used for perfect, momentary grip.

You make it across the 20-foot gap in a matter of seconds, silently landing on the adjacent rooftop.

---

## The Drop

You are now directly above the three men in the alley. The roof edge overhangs the back door of the fish market.

* **Spike** (the fence with the gold tooth) is leaning against the door, still engaged in a quiet, tense argument. His oilskin coat, with the bulge of the letters, is visible.
* The **two thugs** are facing him, slightly blocking the alleyway, their attention focused entirely on Spike.
* You are about **8 feet** directly above them.

This is the perfect chance for a clean hit, but the rain is making the landing spot slick. You could drop straight onto Spike, or try to take a cleaner, quieter path.

**What does Trix do?**

1.  **Direct Drop (Grapple/Takedown):** Drop directly onto Spike, attempting to knock him down and secure the letters in one swift move. This will require a **Stealth (DEX)** check (DC 15) to land quietly and an **Athletics (STR)** check to grapple him if you succeed.
2.  **Edge Drop (Quiet Approach):** Lower yourself silently to the edge of the roof overhang, then drop to the alley floor a few feet away from them, relying on your **Stealth** to set up a clean pickpocket. This will require a single, difficult **Stealth (DEX)** check (DC 17).
3.  **Ranged Attack (Aggressive):** Draw your shortbow and fire a warning shot or an attack at one of the thugs to cause a distraction. This will start combat immediately.

---
We're gonna do the edge drop. Go in nice and quiet, hoping there is enough distraction and noise to keep them occupied.

---

A silent approach is a rogue's best strategy. Trix decides to trust his **Stealth Expertise** to slip in unnoticed and get into position for the snatch.

You flatten Trix low on the wet stone, then slowly begin to lower himself over the edge of the roof, his short stature being a small advantage here. The drizzle, the distant sound of the docks, and the low, intense bickering of the three men below are covering your movements. The biggest risk is the slick masonry giving way beneath your fingers.

### The Stealth Check

You need to make a difficult **Stealth (DEX)** check to execute this maneuver flawlessly.

**Your Modifier:** +3  (DEX)+ 4  (Expertise Double Prof.)= +7

**Please make a 1d20+ 7 roll and tell me the result!**
---
17

---
A roll of 17, plus Trix's Stealth modifier of +7, results in a total of 24!

'''
I discussed offline how Gemini shouldn't have added the +7 based on the prompt. We need to watch for this error.
'''

A roll of 17, plus Trix's Stealth modifier of +7, results in a total of **24**!

You execute the Edge Drop with stunning grace. Trix becomes a shadow on the wall, his gloves finding purchase on the slick, wet stones as he silently lowers himself. He drops the final few feet, landing on the cobblestones with the weight of a feather. The sound of the rain against the oilskin coats of the men covers the minuscule noise he makes.

You are now standing flat against the wall, just **five feet** behind Spike and his two thugs. They are still intensely focused on their argument.

> "I told you, the Duke's letter is worth a dozen times what you're offering!" Spike hisses, his gold tooth flashing under the flickering gaslight of the fish market's sign.
>
> "It's tainted goods, Spike. Tainted," growls the larger thug, stepping closer.

Trix is in the perfect position. The letters are right there in Spike's inner pocket, and the men are completely unaware.

***

**What does Trix do now?**

1.  **The Snatch:** Attempt to quickly and silently **pickpocket** the letters from Spike's inner coat pocket and retreat into the shadows. (This will be a **Sleight of Hand (DEX) check**, opposed by Spike's **Passive Perception**).
2.  **The Distraction:** Toss one of your daggers or a small stone to the far end of the alley to draw the men's attention away before going for the pocket.
3.  **The Eavesdrop:** Remain perfectly still and try to glean more information from their tense conversation before making a move. (This will be a simple **Perception (WIS) check**).

---
Eavesdrop a little more. I'm curious

---
Trix holds his breath, flattening himself against the cold, wet wall. The three men are so focused on their conflict that the rogue becomes just another part of the alley's shadows and rain-slicked masonry.

You strain your ears to pick out the details of the argument over the steady patter of the rain. This requires a **Perception (WIS)** check.

**Your Modifier:** +1  (WIS)+ 2  (Proficiency)= +3

**Please make a 1d20+ 3 roll and tell me the result!**

---

14

---

'''
Again, incorrect calculation
'''

A roll of 14, plus Trix's Perception modifier of +3, gives you a total of **17**.

You manage to tune out the distracting background noise of the rain and the docks, focusing only on the sharp, tense whispers of the three men.

The larger thug's voice, gravelly and low, is saying: "...tainted goods, Spike. She knows they're missing. Her **bodyguard** is scouring the south ward, looking for anyone holding the Duke's *seal*."

Spike spits a wet stream onto the cobblestones. "The seal's intact, you idiot. She's got no proof I touched 'em. They're valuable because of *who* they're about—that mage in the **Ivory Tower**. Now, are you giving me 50 gold, or am I finding a new buyer for the whole stack?"

The smaller thug finally speaks, his voice a tense, high squeak: "We can't pay that! Just tell us if they mention the **Shattered Crown**—that's all she wants to know."

Spike laughs, a wet, rattling sound. "The Crown? You think I read these things? Too risky! I only care about the gold. Now make a choice before I decide you're too much trouble..."

---

### Situation Update

You now have a much clearer picture of the stakes:

* The letters are from the **Duke** to someone (a lover? a spy?) and are being sought by a powerful woman and her **bodyguard**.
* The letters contain information about a **mage in the Ivory Tower**—perhaps a key figure for a future magical education?
* The thugs are specifically interested in any mention of the **Shattered Crown**.

You are still perfectly hidden, five feet behind Spike. The three men are now locked in a stalemate, their hands hovering near their belts.

**What does Trix do next?**

1.  **The Snatch:** Attempt to quickly and silently **pickpocket** the letters from Spike's inner coat pocket and retreat. (This is a **Sleight of Hand (DEX) check**, opposed by Spike's **Passive Perception** of 10).
2.  **The Distraction:** Toss a dagger or coin to the far end of the alley to make a noise and draw their attention, creating a window for the snatch.
3.  **The Dialogue:** Attempt to join the conversation, perhaps pretending to be a lookout or an intermediary. (This would require a **Deception (CHA) check**).

---
Go for the Snatch

---
![Trix Swipes Letters](Trix_swipes_letters.png)
Trix has heard enough. The stakes are getting complicated, and a wizard's bodyguard is the last thing he wants to deal with. It's time to get the gold, or at least the information worth it.

You press your advantage, using the tense silence between the arguing men. You move with expert precision, your hand snaking out from the shadows.

### The Snatch: Pickpocket Check

This is a **Sleight of Hand (DEX) check**, opposed by Spike's awareness.

* **Trix's Sleight of Hand Modifier (Expertise):** +3  (DEX)+ 4  (Double Prof.)= +7
* **Spike's Passive Perception (The DC):** 10

You need to roll a 1d20+ 7 and get a result of **10 or higher**.

**Please make the 1d20+ 7 roll for Trix's Sleight of Hand!**

---
11

--
A roll of 11, plus Trix's Sleight of Hand modifier of +7, results in a stunning total of **18**.

Trix is a master of the silent touch. Your hand dips beneath Spike's oilskin coat and into the inner pocket. The man is still furiously focused on the thugs, his core muscles tight with anger, but he doesn't feel the feather-light pressure of your fingers.

Your touch finds a thick packet of sealed paper. With a fluid, expert motion, you secure the letters and pull your hand back out. Not a single seal is broken, and not a single rustle of fabric betrays the theft.

The letters are now secured in Trix's own pocket.

### Escape!

You have the prize, but you are still five feet behind three armed, angry men in a narrow alley. Spike is now reaching under his own coat for what you can assume is a dagger, preparing to escalate the argument.

**Top-Pinned Summary Reminder:** *Trix is a **Level 1 Stout Halfling Rogue** with **25 ft. Speed** and the **City Secrets** background feature.*

***

**What does Trix do?**

1.  **Swift Retreat:** Use your speed to slip back into the shadows and run down the alleyway, relying on your small size and **Stealth** to avoid immediate pursuit.
2.  **The Counter-Distraction:** Toss a single gold coin loudly toward the mouth of the alley, then dash away in the opposite direction (toward the docks).
3.  **Use City Secrets:** Locate a hidden entrance or a quick vertical escape route nearby (requires a moment of thought but guarantees a cleaner escape).

---

We're going to try a counter distraction, and throw a stone that I have in my pocket. I will be throwing it somewhere that I know will make the right noise and also where I can locate it again later.

---

A calculated distraction using a tool you already possess—very fitting for a seasoned thief like Trix!

You've got the packet of letters and a moment of valuable silence. You reach into your pouch and secure the **smooth stone** you carry, your fingers adjusting its weight. You need to choose a target that will draw attention but not ruin your chance to come back for the stone (or whatever it impacts) later.

You spot the perfect target: A small, rickety **metal oil lamp** hanging by a rusted chain about 30 feet down the alleyway, near a stack of discarded barrels. If you hit it, it will create a loud, distinctive **CLANG** that will sound like a scuffle starting elsewhere.

### The Throw: Attack Roll

To toss the stone accurately and create a clean distraction, this will require a Ranged Attack roll, using your Dexterity.

* **Trix's Ranged Attack Modifier:** +DEX Modifier+ Proficiency Bonus= +3 + 2 = +5

The lamp is a small, inanimate target, so let's set the **Difficulty Class (DC)** to hit it at **12**.

**Please make a 1d20+ 5 attack roll and tell me the result!**

---

I rolled a 7

---
A roll of 7, plus Trix's Ranged Attack modifier of +5, results in a total of **12**.

That is *exactly* what you needed!

You draw your arm back and snap the smooth stone forward with a low, precise wrist flick. The stone zips through the rainy air, narrowly missing a dangling piece of wet laundry, and strikes the **metal oil lamp** with a sharp, echoing **CLANG!**

The lamp swings violently, casting erratic, dancing shadows down the alley.

All three men—Spike and the two thugs—instantly whirl around, their hands now fully grasping the weapons under their coats, their eyes trained on the sudden noise and the swinging lamp at the far end of the alley.

> "What in the blazes was that?" Spike shouts, momentarily forgetting the negotiation.
>
> "Sounds like someone's found the back way in!" the smaller thug hisses, starting to move toward the noise.

You have bought yourself a critical moment of attention. The path behind them, toward the back door of the fish market, is clear.

***

**Trix's Situation:**

* **You have the Letters:** Secured in your pocket.
* **The Enemies are Distracted:** All three men are facing away from you and are moving toward the end of the alley.
* **Your Escape Route is Open:** You can slip past them and head toward the fish market's back door or deeper into the alley.

**What does Trix do?**

1.  **Dash and Hide:** Run toward the fish market's back door, use the **City Secrets** feature to find a quick, safe hiding spot, and then observe the men's reaction.
2.  **Double Back:** Slip into the shadows further down the alley, opposite where the men are looking, and try to loop around the block to get away clean.
3.  **The Bold Run:** Just run full speed out of the alley mouth and into the general chaos of the Wet Quarter docks.


---

Dash and Hide

---
Trix doesn't hesitate. With the loud *clang* still ringing in the alley, the three men have their backs completely turned, staring down the lane at the swinging lantern.

You dart out from your hiding spot by the wall. Your small size and speed work to your advantage as you move past the two towering thugs and the sputtering Spike. You slip cleanly to the back door of the fish market, which your **City Secrets** instinct tells you should be unlocked for the night haulers.

### The Hide

You successfully reach the door, which yields with a soft, wet creak. You slip inside, pulling the door almost shut behind you, leaving only a sliver of darkness to peer through.

The air inside the market is thick with the cold, overwhelming smell of brine and stale fish. The room is dimly lit by a single bulb and lined with wooden tables and ice chests.

You are now in your hiding position, unseen. Outside, the thugs are now moving with purpose toward the swinging lantern.

> **Thug 1:** "See! I told you someone was trying to draw us off. Check those barrels!"
>
> **Spike:** "Stay here! That's too simple. Check the roofline! I don't feel right about this. Where are those bloody letters—?"

Spike has just checked his pocket and realized the letters are gone! He whirls back toward the back door, but Trix is already inside. He looks frantically around the empty cobblestones where you were just a moment ago.

The three men are now in full panic.

**What does Trix do next?**

1.  **Escape:** Use the interior of the fish market to find another exit (perhaps a front door or a service alley) and get out of the Quarter entirely.
2.  **Observe:** Stay hidden for a moment longer to see if the men split up, or if Spike gives any more crucial information about the **Ivory Tower Mage** or the **Shattered Crown**.

---

escape

---

Trix has the goods, and the situation is escalating. It's time to vanish.

You don't waste a second lingering on the cryptic words about the **Shattered Crown** or the **Ivory Tower Mage**. The pungent interior of the fish market is your new hunting ground.

You move with the trained silence of a rogue, weaving past the hanging nets and damp burlap sacks. Your eyes immediately lock onto a faint slice of light at the far end of the market—a second exit leading to a smaller, quieter service alley.

### The Great Escape

You dash for the back alley, reaching the second door with ease. It's a wooden door, secured by a simple sliding bolt. You yank the bolt open just as you hear Spike's voice, growing louder and frantic, from the alley entrance you just came through.

> "He must have gone in! Find him! Check the back, check the roof, check everything! If she finds out I lost those letters, I'm swimming with the cod!"

You slip through the door and into a narrow, stone-walled service alley. It's dark, filled with barrels of refuse, and, crucially, **empty**. You have a clear path away from the dockside drama.

Trix has successfully secured the sealed letters and escaped the pursuit!

***

## Safe House and the Letters

After several tense minutes of running the winding, damp back alleys of the Wet Quarter, you finally slow to a walk once you reach the brighter, main thoroughfare near the Temple District. You duck into a recessed doorway, catching your breath.

You pull the packet of letters from your pocket. They are stiff, sealed with expensive red wax bearing the distinctive **sigil of the Duke**, and tied with fine velvet ribbon. You managed to get away without even a smudge on them.

**What does Trix do with the Duke's sealed letters?**

1.  **Examine Closely:** Carefully inspect the exterior of the letters and the wax seals for any unusual markings, traps, or clues about the contents. This requires an **Investigation (INT)** check.
2.  **Take Them to the Innkeeper:** Immediately head to the safe haven of your Innkeeper friend (your **Bond**) to stash the letters and share the details of the job.
3.  **Break the Seal:** Decide the information is too tempting to ignore, and risk breaking the Duke's seal to finally read about the **Ivory Tower Mage** and the **Shattered Crown**.

---

Examine the wax seals.

Trix holds the thick packet of sealed letters close in the dim light of the doorway. The fine, cold rain hasn't dampened the expensive wax seals, which are stamped with the intricate, unmistakable **sigil of the Duke**: a rearing griffin clutching a laurel wreath.

You decide to inspect the seals and the paper carefully, looking for anything that might indicate a trap or a clue. This requires an **Investigation (INT)** check.

**Trix's Investigation Modifier:** -1  (INT)+ 2  (Proficiency)= +1

**Please make a 1d20+ 1 roll and tell me the result!**

---

11

---

### Investigation Check Result

You rolled an 11. Adding Trix's Investigation modifier of **+1** gives a total of **12**.

Trix is careful and methodical, inspecting the expensive red wax seals and the Duke's distinctive **griffin sigil**. Your expertise in small, valuable objects serves you well.

**What you discover:**

* **Authenticity:** The seals are not cheap imitations; they are genuine and freshly stamped. The craftsmanship is highly professional, making them extremely difficult to peel without leaving a clear trace of tampering.
* **No Traps:** Trix finds no evidence of magical glyphs, poisons, or mechanical traps designed to injure the opener. They are simply secured by mundane, though high-quality, means.
* **The Ribbon:** The velvet ribbon is tied in an unusually complex **sailor's knot**, indicating the sender or receiver may have connections to the maritime trade or the Navy.

The letters are definitely authentic and important. Opening them without expertise would be noticed instantly by anyone checking the seal, confirming to the Duke (or his bodyguard) that the package has been tampered with.

***

Trix has the letters, knows they're valuable, and knows they are too secure to open without risk. He also knows the thugs were interested in the **Shattered Crown** and the Duke's agent is hunting the thief.

**What does Trix do now?**

1.  **Take Them to the Innkeeper:** Immediately head to the safe haven of your Innkeeper friend (your **Bond**) to stash the letters and decide on the next move.
2.  **Find a Fence:** Try to sell the letters immediately, seeking out a contact who might be interested in the information about the **Ivory Tower Mage** or the **Shattered Crown**.
3.  **Break the Seal (Risk it):** Decide the information is worth the risk of discovery and try to use your **Thieves' Tools** to carefully steam and remove the seal. (This would require a difficult Thieves' Tools check).

---

Break the seal with my Thieves tool

---
The thrill of discovery outweighs the risk! Trix decides he simply **must** know what secrets lie within the Duke's sealed letters, especially since the contents concern a **mage** and the **Shattered Crown**.

You dart into a tiny, recessed alcove shielded from the rain and pull out your **Thieves' Tools**. The seal is complex and professional, meaning this will be a delicate, difficult process.

### The Locksmith Challenge

You will attempt to use your Thieves' Tools to carefully heat and steam the wax seal just enough to lift it, allowing you to read the contents without leaving a trace of tampering.

This requires a **Dexterity check** using your proficiency with Thieves' Tools. The inherent difficulty of the authentic ducal seal makes this a **DC 15** challenge.

* **Trix's Thieves' Tools Modifier:** +3  (DEX)+ 2  (Proficiency)= +5

**Please give me the raw 1d20 roll for this check!**

---

Oh boy. It's only 3

---

You roll a 3!

Adding Trix's Thieves' Tools modifier of **+5** gives you a total of **8**.

That is unfortunately not enough to beat the **DC 15** for such a delicate task.

### Disaster!

As Trix works with his tools, his breath hitching as he tries to maintain perfect focus, a gust of wind whips through the alcove. The wax, momentarily softened by a carefully applied burst of heat from your tiny oil lamp, catches the draft and **cracks sharply**.

The distinctive **griffin sigil** is ruined, splitting into three jagged pieces. The once-pristine seal is now undeniably **tampered with**. You managed to open the packet of letters, but you did so clumsily, leaving clear evidence of a forced entry.

The good news is, the letters are now open and readable!

***

## The Secrets Revealed

You quickly pull out the top letter, shielding it from the rain. It is written in a hurried, elegant script, addressed from the Duke to a woman named **"Lyra."** Trix scans the urgent lines:

> *"...the situation at the **Ivory Tower** is worse than we thought. The master mage, **Soron**, has sealed the upper levels and refuses to respond. My agents believe he is preparing to use the **Shattered Crown** artifact, which we foolishly allowed him to study. If he combines its power with the Tower's ancient focus, the entire district will be caught in his spell. You must recover the Crown, Lyra, before the next full moon. I have dispatched a unit—a captain and a brute—to the docks to meet with Spike. Do not fail me."*

### Situation Update

You have the secrets, and the letters confirm the urgency of the situation and the identity of the powerful foes:

* **The Threat:** Master Mage **Soron** at the **Ivory Tower** plans to use an artifact called the **Shattered Crown**.
* **The Deadline:** He plans to do this before the **next full moon**.
* **The Enemies:** Spike and his thugs are now looking for you, and a highly capable **captain and a brute**—likely the bodyguard mentioned earlier—are now at the docks looking for the letters that *you* now possess.

You are still in a dark alcove on a major thoroughfare. The letters are visibly broken, and your hands are shaky from the close call.

**What does Trix do now?**

1.  **Head to the Innkeeper:** Immediately seek safety and counsel from your trusted friend (your **Bond**) to stash the letters and share the details of this potentially world-changing plot.
2.  **Act on the Information:** You now know a mage is involved. You could head to the **Ivory Tower** or start looking for the **Shattered Crown** yourself.
3.  **Find a Fence (Still):** Sell the information (or the remaining letters) to the highest bidder—maybe one of the Duke's enemies—to secure your seed money for magic.


Excellent. To bring **Silas** into the story and finalize the context for your two-person party, let's establish **how** and **why** Silas meets up with Trix right now. This integration will update your **Plot Context** and **Party Status** sections.

### Integration of Silas

We can weave Silas's existing backstory (*Investigator background, searching for his captain's killer*) directly into the current situation:

  * **The Connection:** Silas, using his Investigator contacts, had been tracking the movements of Spike's thugs, believing they were connected to the **secret society** that murdered his former captain.
  * **The Meeting:** Silas was actively staking out the Wet Quarter docks when the commotion happened—the **metal clang** of Trix's distraction and the subsequent panic. Silas's keen eye allowed him to notice the small figure (Trix) slip away from the scene and into the Temple District.
  * **The Follow:** Silas has followed Trix to the alcove, not to arrest him, but because Trix's theft of the Duke's letters may have just uncovered the lead Silas has been searching for.

We are now ready to begin the **Shattered Crown Heist**\!

![Silas and Trix](Silas_meets_Trix.png)
**The Scene:** Trix is still huddled in the alcove, the broken seal of the Duke's letter in his hand. He knows he needs to move fast. Just as he goes to slip the paper back into his coat, a quiet voice cuts through the drizzle from the alleyway:

> "Hold still, little friend. Whatever is in those letters, I have a hunch it's what killed my captain. Let's talk about the truth before those thugs catch your scent."

**Silas** steps out of the shadows, his longbow resting easily in his hand, his eyes calm but sharp.

**What does Trix do?**

I would be happy to remind you of the contents of the Duke's letters.

You scanned the top letter, addressed from the **Duke** to a woman named **"Lyra."**

---
As a reminder, can you tell me what the letters said once I read them?

---

## Contents of the Duke's Stolen Letter

The letter revealed the following critical information, which Trix secured just before being discovered by Silas:

1.  **The Threat:** The master mage, **Soron**, at the **Ivory Tower** has sealed the upper levels and refuses to communicate.
2.  **The Artifact:** The Duke believes Soron is preparing to use an artifact called the **Shattered Crown**, which the Duke foolishly allowed him to study.
3.  **The Danger:** If Soron combines the Crown's power with the Tower's ancient focus, the entire district will be caught in his spell.
4.  **The Deadline:** The Crown must be recovered before the **next full moon**.
5.  **The Agents:** The Duke dispatched agents (a captain and a brute) to the docks to meet with Spike to begin the recovery operation (the same agents now searching for Trix).

***

**The Scene:** Trix is still huddled in the alcove, the broken seal of the Duke's letter in his hand. He knows he needs to move fast. Just as he goes to slip the paper back into his coat, a quiet voice cuts through the drizzle from the alleyway:

> "Hold still, little friend. Whatever is in those letters, I have a hunch it's what killed my captain. Let's talk about the truth before those thugs catch your scent."

**Silas** steps out of the shadows, his longbow resting easily in his hand, his eyes calm but sharp.

**What does Trix do?**

---

Okay, change of plans. Silas will have to leave the scene at the moment, and I want to bring Grog in. Do you remember Grog, or do I need to paste his details? The way I'm suggesting is that Trix will acknowledge Silas, but run away for the moment. How should we introduce Grog?

This is an exciting shift! Switching the immediate challenge is great for pacing.

I absolutely remember **Grog**, the gentle Half-Orc Barbarian, and have his full profile stored and ready. We can introduce him immediately.

Here is how Trix acknowledges Silas and escapes, leading directly into the introduction of Grog:

---

### The Scene Continues: Trix Escapes

Trix’s eyes dart from Silas’s calm, weapon-ready stance to the broken seal in his hand. The letter's contents are too explosive to risk a chat right now, especially with pursuit imminent.

> Trix keeps his voice low and fast. "Captain's killer? Good to know! But if we stand here talking about it, the Duke's *actual* agents will be using *our* faces to scrub the alley stones. Your hunch is right, mine says run."

Trix snaps the letter packet into his coat and, with the quick, darting movement of a halfling, he pushes off the alcove wall, not running down the main alley (where Silas expects him to go), but cutting sharply across the narrow street toward the main plaza of the Temple District.

Silas, surprised by the sheer speed of the small rogue, doesn't immediately pursue, instead taking a moment to scan for threats Trix mentioned.

### Grog's Introduction

Trix bursts out of the side alley, into the broad, rain-slicked **Temple Square**. The square is usually busy, but the late hour and rain have thinned the crowd to a few cloaked figures and a handful of late-night vendors.

Trix immediately collides with an obstacle: a mountain of a man who is standing still, his massive back to Trix. This man, a **Half-Orc**, is staring intently, and rather sadly, at a decorative, waist-high stone planter that he has somehow managed to **crack clean in half**. He seems completely oblivious to Trix's presence or the surrounding danger.

This is **Grog**.

Trix is now pressed against the back of an enormous, powerful figure. Grog's wide stance and massive frame completely block the halfling from view of the alley he just fled.

**What does Trix do next?**

1.  **Recruit:** Quickly whisper to Grog, "Guard duty! The guards are coming for the sacred plant! Protect it!" (This would require a fast **Deception (CHA) check**).
2.  **Hide:** Use Grog's massive bulk as immediate cover and try to melt into the larger shadows of the Temple Square before Grog notices him. (This would require a **Stealth (DEX) check**).
3.  **Dash:** Immediately slip out from behind Grog and bolt across the Temple Square, relying on his speed to outpace any pursuers (risking Grog's sudden attention).

---

Let's go with Recruit option. Also, Grog will be played by another person that is with me, so it would be appropriate to ask us both for behavioral decisions, or as a party (if he joins Trix).

---

That's an excellent choice, Trix! Using your quick wit and a tall tale to weaponize the Barbarian is perfectly in character. And absolutely—since Grog has entered the scene, all subsequent narrative choices that affect both characters will be presented to you as a party.

### Recruiting Grog

Trix acts instantly, recognizing Grog's bulk as the perfect shield. You press tight against the half-orc's back, your voice a frantic, conspiratorial whisper, using Grog's exposed **Ideal (Protection)** against him.

> "Hey! Big friend! I'm the lookout! The City Watch is about to round the corner, and they're coming for that... that **sacred plant**! They want to confiscate it! You've got to protect it! Right now!"

To convince Grog that this sudden order is real and important, Trix needs to be persuasive. This is a **Deception (CHA) check**.

* **Trix's Deception Modifier:** **+1** (CHA Mod)
* **The Difficulty Class (DC):** **10**. Since Grog is not city-smart (INT 8, WIS 12) and is preoccupied, he's only moderately difficult to deceive.

**Please give me the raw 1d20 roll for Trix's Deception check!**
---

Trix rolls a raw 12
---

A raw roll of 12, plus Trix's Deception modifier of **+1**, results in a total of **13**.

This beats the DC 10! Trix's frantic whisper and Charisma are convincing enough to sway the simple-minded Barbarian.

### Grog Acts

Grog, focused on the tragic, cracked planter, blinks his eyes and processes the frantic warning. The idea of someone stealing a **sacred plant** immediately triggers his **Ideal of Protection**. He may not know what a "sacred plant" is, but he knows he must defend it.

> Grog lets out a low, guttural growl, his gaze snapping from the cracked stone to the mouth of the alley where Trix came from. "Steal? No. We protect."

Grog immediately plants his feet, shifting his massive frame. He secures his Great Axe in one hand and uses his other hand to roughly, but not maliciously, hold Trix securely pinned behind his thigh, keeping the Halfling out of sight.

**Trix is now hidden behind Grog.**

Just as Grog takes his protective stance, you hear the pounding of boots getting closer. Spike and one of the thugs, having failed to find the source of the **CLANG**, are now backtracking and are quickly rounding the corner of the alley, heading directly for the Temple Square.

### Party Status

* **Trix:** Hidden behind Grog. (Cannot be targeted or seen by Spike/Thug.)
* **Grog:** Standing in the open, focused on the alley entrance, armed.
* **Spike & Thug:** Approaching, about 40 feet away, looking for a small, stealthy thief.
* **Silas:** Still in the side alley, observing the scene.

---

## Party Decision: Trix & Grog

You are now a team facing immediate danger. The pursuers are focused on finding Trix, but Grog's sudden, suspicious presence will certainly draw their attention.

**What is the party's action for the start of this encounter?**

1.  **Grog: Intimidate.** Grog steps forward, brandishing his Great Axe to scare them off and hold them back, while Trix prepares a follow-up action. (This requires an **Intimidation (CHA) check** from Grog).
2.  **Trix: Setup/Distraction.** Trix uses Grog's cover to ready his shortbow and fire a warning shot, or throw a dagger at a nearby object to cause another distraction.
3.  **Trix & Grog: Flee.** Trix whispers instructions to Grog, and the two attempt to run across the large, open Temple Square to reach cover near the main Cathedral.

---
We'll go with Grog being the Intimidator if Spike, thug or if the Captain and the Brute were to come along. Grog utters "Stay away from this plant" if provoked.

---

That's an excellent plan. Grog is positioned perfectly to draw all the attention, and his simple, protective stance plays right into his character.

As the party prepares, the pursuers round the corner.

### The Encounter Begins

Spike and one of the thugs—a muscular brute carrying a heavy sack of tools—come jogging around the corner of the alley, their eyes wide and scanning for a tiny Halfling. They don't see Trix, but they instantly see **Grog**.

Grog stands like a monument carved from granite. The huge Half-Orc is planted firmly in the square, his back to the broken planter (and the hiding Trix), his massive Great Axe held casually, but clearly ready, across his body.

The thugs skid to a halt, completely thrown off. They were hunting a rogue, not a wall of muscle.

> **Spike:** (Squinting through the rain) "Hey! What in the blazes are you doing? Move it, you ox! We're looking for a thief!"

Grog locks his intense gaze on Spike and the thug. He doesn't move, but his voice rumbles like stone grinding against stone, fully executing your instruction.

> **Grog:** "**Stay away from this plant.**"

### Grog's Intimidation

Grog's sheer size and the implied threat of the Great Axe are your primary weapon here. This is a **Charisma (Intimidation) check** from Grog.

* **Grog's Intimidation Modifier:** **+0** (CHA Mod, not proficient)
* **The Difficulty Class (DC):** **14**. Spike and his thug are tough individuals, not easily scared by simple muscle, so this is a moderate challenge.

**Please give me the raw 1d20 roll for Grog's Intimidation check!**

---

Grog rolls a 15
---

A raw roll of 15, plus Grog's Intimidation modifier of **+0**, results in a total of **15**.

This easily beats the **DC 14**!

### Intimidation Success

Grog's sheer size and the primal, protective rage in his eyes are profoundly unsettling. The casual way he handles the Great Axe, combined with the strange, deadpan line about the "plant," makes Spike realize this isn't a casual brawl—this is a genuine lunatic, and possibly a powerful one.

Spike's face, already tight with rain and stress, twists further in frustration.

> **Spike:** (Backing up a step, waving his hand) "Forget it! Forget the bloody plant! That's not what we're here for! Come on, Jax! Leave the monster to his weeds. He's not the Halfling. Let's check the roofline!"

Spike and the thug Jax immediately abandon the confrontation. They turn and jog back the way they came, their focus now shifting to searching the rooftops and windows, looking for the *small, sneaky* target they were originally hunting.

The coast is clear for the moment! Grog's intimidating presence has successfully diverted the immediate threat.

---

## Party Status Update

* **Trix:** Still safely hidden behind Grog. The immediate pursuit has been scared off.
* **Grog:** Standing in the open, convinced he just protected a sacred plant from thieves.
* **Silas:** Still observing the scene from the side alley, now seeing his potential rogue lead recruit a gigantic bodyguard.
* **Threat:** Spike and his thug Jax are gone, but the **Captain and Brute** are still out there, and they are far more dangerous.

### Next Action

Trix has successfully used Grog as a shield. The time to run is now, while the Temple Square is clear. You have Grog's attention and his loyalty (for the moment).

**What is the party's next action?**

1.  **Trix: Consolidate.** Trix whispers to Grog, "Good job, Protector! Now follow me! We have to move the plant to safety!" Lead Grog out of the Temple Square and into a safer, crowded area.
2.  **Trix: Engage Silas.** Trix whispers to Grog to stay put, and Trix slips away to immediately talk to the Half-Elf Ranger who is still watching from the shadows.
3.  **Grog: Search.** Grog decides to search the planter for the "sacred plant" he was protecting (a choice Grog's player would make, but Trix needs to act first).

---

Let's go to the innkeeper. I'd like to settle in and take another look at these letters, maybe even ask the Innkeeper what he thinks. Trix offers Grog some food and Grog confirms that he is willing.

---

That is the wisest course of action. The Innkeeper is Trix's only **Bond** and the safest haven in the city. You need to get off the street before the Duke's highly competent agents arrive.

### 1. Consolidating the Party

Trix quickly acts while Grog is still in his protective stance.

> **Trix:** (Whispering up to Grog's massive ear) "Brilliant work, Protector! They're beaten! Now we have to move that sacred plant to a **safe location**."

Grog looks down at the tiny Halfling with satisfied, if slightly dull, eyes.

> **Grog:** (Nodding slowly, rumbling) "Safe. Yes. Protect the plant."

Trix slips out from behind Grog and leads the way, darting through the wide Temple Square and into the network of main streets that lead toward the general area of the Wet Quarter, where the Innkeeper's establishment is likely located.

> **Trix:** "And, uh, once we get there, they have **food**. Really good food. I can definitely get you some food, big guy."

> **Grog:** (His eyes lighting up slightly) "Food. Good."

Grog is now securely in tow, his immediate loyalty secured by the promise of a meal and the continued, vague mission of "protection."

### 2. The Journey to the Inn

As Trix and Grog quickly move away from the dockside districts, a final figure slips from the shadows of the alley—**Silas**.

Silas watches the strange pair—a tiny rogue and a massive half-orc—disappear into the main thoroughfares. He knows the docks are about to be flooded with serious agents. He has seen the letters, the chaos, and now this odd pairing.

Silas, the Investigator, decides that following the chaos is the best way to uncover the truth about his captain's murder and the secret society. He begins to follow Trix and Grog at a distance, using his **Stealth** and **Perception** to remain unseen.

***

### 3. Arrival at the Innkeeper's

Trix leads Grog down several winding, cobblestone streets, eventually arriving in a quieter, slightly older section of the city. You approach a small, unassuming establishment called **"The Bent Mug."** It's late, and the lights are mostly dimmed, but Trix knows the back entrance is always unlocked for him.

You slip through the back door, pulling Grog—who has to duck slightly—inside the warm, quiet kitchen.

The kitchen smells of old spices, warm bread, and a touch of sour ale. A thin, kindly older human woman, the **Innkeeper**, is sitting at a small table, nursing a cup of tea. She looks up, her eyes immediately going wide at the sight of the giant Half-Orc crammed into her kitchen.

> **Innkeeper:** (Whispering, slightly panicked) "Trix! Gods above! What have you brought me this time?"

**Current Situation:**

* **Location:** The safe haven of **The Bent Mug** (Innkeeper's kitchen).
* **Party:** Trix and Grog (Silas is likely staking out the front alley).
* **Immediate Needs:** Grog needs food, Trix needs to consult on the letters.

**What does Trix say or do first?**

---

Grog introduces himself politely to the innkeeper. Trix lets her know that he promised him food and that he's saved his butt earlier.

---

This is a crucial social test for the new party dynamic!

The massive Half-Orc, still focused on his mission of protection (and the promise of a meal), turns his immense frame towards the startled Innkeeper.

> **Grog:** (His voice a deep, respectful rumble, trying to be as gentle as possible) "Greetings. My name is Grog. I am protector. And hungry."

Trix steps forward quickly, placing a comforting hand on his friend's arm and addressing the Innkeeper with a reassuring, yet urgent, tone.

> **Trix:** "It's alright, friend. He's good! He's *our* good. I promised him food—the best you have—because he just saved my hide from Spike and his men right in the middle of the square. He's protection, and right now, we desperately need it."

The Innkeeper, used to Trix's wild escapades but still wary of the sheer size of Grog, takes a long, slow breath. Her eyes linger on Grog, assessing the giant's sincerity, before settling on Trix's face. She sees the genuine stress there, and the broken wax seal of the letters Trix is still clutching.

> **Innkeeper:** (Her voice softening) "Very well. A meal for a protector is a small price to pay for your safety, Trix. There's a back table, away from the windows. Sit. Both of you. Quickly."

She points to a corner of the kitchen, near a shadowed pantry. She moves with surprising speed, placing a massive loaf of brown bread, a bowl of stew, and a large mug of ale in front of Grog.

### Safe Haven, For Now

Grog settles down with a sigh of relief that shakes the floorboards, immediately focusing on the food with great enthusiasm. The Innkeeper turns her attention back to Trix, her expression now serious and concerned.

> **Innkeeper:** "Now, what is it you ran off with this time that brings Spike, the City Watch—and that... *giant*—to my door? And why does that seal look like it was attacked by a badger?"

Trix now has the opportunity to brief his trusted ally.

**What is Trix's next action?**

1.  **Briefing:** Trix immediately shows the Innkeeper the shattered letters and explains the plot of the **Shattered Crown**, the **Ivory Tower Mage (Soron)**, and the Duke's involvement.
2.  **Ask for Help:** Trix explains the situation but asks the Innkeeper if she knows anything about the key terms: **Shattered Crown**, **Ivory Tower Mage**, or the agents of the Duke.
3.  **Rest & Watch:** Trix tells the Innkeeper that the situation is grave, but insists that he needs a few hours of rest before making any decisions, while Grog keeps watch.
