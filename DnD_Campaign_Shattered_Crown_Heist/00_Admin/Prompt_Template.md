Export in MD
Let's try the characters now. I'd like an MD to include Silas' Summary/Context, Basics, Personality, Core Stats & Defense, Ability Scores & Modifiers, and Proficiencies. Use fewer tables. so it can be legible when still in MD. Core Stats, Ability Scores and Proficiencies can be in tables.


Part 1 - Describe Character
Let's add a magic user-- able to do some light combat, perhaps with a bow or dagger, but more reliant on spellcasting. Comfortable in society but also good with common folk-- versatile, clever, and charismatic




Part 2 - Flesh out
I like that Character. Can you flesh out the Personality in the form of : Alignment,Class Feature,Weapons,Armor,Gear,Background Feature,Personality Trait,Ideal,Bond,Flaw . Core Stats & Defense and Proficiencies?


Part 3 - Get Image
