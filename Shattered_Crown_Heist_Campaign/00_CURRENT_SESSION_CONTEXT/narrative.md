# A Wet Job in the Wet Quarter
The city of Silverhaven is a bustling, chaotic metropolis, currently being soaked by a relentless, cold drizzle. You, Trix the Halfling Rogue, are currently perched on a slick, moss-covered rooftop in the Wet Quarter—a grimy dockside district known for its smuggled goods and whispered deals.

You’ve been tracking a local fence named "Spike" who is known for hoarding valuable, sealed letters meant for the city's nobility. Trix figured one of those letters would fetch enough coin to start funding his magical education.

Peering down into the narrow alleyway below, you see a flash of light reflecting off a single gold tooth. Spike. He is leaning against the back door of a run-down fish market, arguing quietly with two burly, cloaked thugs who are twice Trix’s size. Spike is wearing a heavy, oilskin coat, and you see the distinct bulge of the letters hidden inside his inner pocket.

The alley is loud with the sound of rain, but getting down there is tricky:

1. A rickety drainpipe runs from your position down to the alley, offering a direct, if noisy, route.

2. The rooftop continues across to the building opposite, and a narrow clothesline is strung between the two—a slower but more discreet option.

Top-Pinned Summary Reminder: Trix is a Level 1 Stout Halfling Rogue with DEX +3 and Expertise in Stealth (+7). He wants the letters to fund his dream of magic.

Trix looks around for any other non obvious way down.

You have Trix pause, scanning the murky alley and the surrounding rooftops for a third, non-obvious route.

The rickety drainpipe and the swaying clothesline are clear risks, but Trix trusts his street instincts over an obvious path. The constant drizzle makes every surface treacherously slick.

You focus your gaze on the roof edge just a few feet away from the fish market. You notice something promising: a series of narrow, empty wooden crates stacked precariously against the wall near the back door. They look like they were meant to be hauled up to a storage loft, but the rope is currently frayed and hanging loose.

If Trix can make a small jump, he could potentially use the crates as unstable stepping stones down the last 15 feet to the ground, positioning himself right behind the three men. The advantage is that this route is likely quieter than the metal drainpipe.

What does Trix do?

1. Go for the Crates: Attempt a running jump to land on the top crate, then carefully climb down. This will require an Acrobatics (DEX) check.

2. Use the Clothesline: Attempt to traverse the rope to the opposite roof, then find another way down from there. This will require a Sleight of Hand (DEX) check to maintain balance.

3. Use the Drainpipe: Risk the loud, direct route and hope the rain covers the noise. This will require a Stealth (DEX) check.

Let's use the Clothesline.

---
Trix eyes the rickety wooden crates and decides they look like an invitation to a broken leg. The clothesline, though exposed, offers a more controlled descent.

It’s about a 20-foot stretch of frayed, wet rope strung between the two buildings. The rain is making the rope slick, and the wind occasionally causes it to sway violently. Trix will need to traverse it quickly and quietly.

The Clothesline Challenge
Roll an Acrobatics (DEX) check to balance on the swaying, wet rope. You are proficient in Acrobatics.

Your Modifier: +3 (DEX)+2 (Proficiency)=+5

Please make a 1d20+5 roll and tell me the result!

(Note: While I suggested Sleight of Hand, Acrobatics is a better fit for a balancing act, and you are proficient in it, so we'll use that!)
